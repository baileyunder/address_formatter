# address_formatter

## Overview

 This was a very simple project in JavaScript. You input text into the fields provided and, upon a button press, the JavaScript will reformat the text given into a standard mailing address format.

## Tools Used

Repl.it Online Code Editor

## Challenges

 The only challenge for this project was deciding on how the text fields would clear. I went about it the hard way and made each individual field clear when the clear button is pressed.
